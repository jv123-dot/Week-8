What is the relationship between a Class and an Object?

A class in OOP is like a template or a blueprint. An object is an instance of that class. 
Classes are useful for code reusability and efficiency. You can create as many instances of a class as necessary

What is an exception, and what are the best practices for handling them?

An exception is when something unexpected happens in programming, like an unexpected error. 
Proper logging of exceptions can help with debugging. Using a try/catch block on data coming from other sources(libraries)
can help you prevent issues with your code

How does the 'extends' keyword work with JavaScript classes?
When you use the extends keyword it causes the created child class to inheret the properties of the parent class, while also utilizing its own code.
Useful to prevent unnecessary duplication of code
